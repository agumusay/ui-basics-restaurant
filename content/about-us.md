We bring you street food straight from North Africa and the Middle East onto your plate – fast, tasty and daily fresh.

Our regularly changing specialties take on you on a trip through the streets and souks of Cairo, Marrakesh, Tunis or Beirut.

At noon, we offer you quick lunch – ordering at the counter and short wait. All meals are also available for take-away. For dinner, you can enjoy Arabic mezze and selected wines  in a cozy atmosphere with service at the table.

We are creative and like adding our own personal touch. Besides classic dishes from the cuisines of North Africa and the Middle East, we therefore also offer you our interpretations of these “classics”.

We want you to feel good. This is why all our food is homemade using high-quality ingredients, self-made spice blends and fresh herbs. All animal products are sourced from controlled organic producers.
